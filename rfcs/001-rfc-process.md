# RFC Process

The goal of these RFCs is to document the through process that goes into
building the Vienna game engine.

There are no rigorous requirements for these documents, and they'll probably
start off mostly as copies of local notes and scribbles.

The RFCs aren't set in stone either, they'll be updated as the thought process
evolves.
