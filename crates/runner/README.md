# Vienna: Runner

The `vienna-runner` crate will become the binary to run the engine with a set of
external configuration files and assets. This allows you to distribute a visual
novel without having to compile the game itself.

Until then, the purpose of this crate is to allow running `cargo run` from the
project root to test the engine.
